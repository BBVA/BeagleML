# Contributing

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** this repo
 2. **Clone** the project into your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Please be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request :)

If your pull request doesn't get merged, don't feel discouraged or be upset. In case there was any
problem with the implementation you may still receive some feedback. Your contribution is of an 
invaluable help to evolve and improve this project.

Also, please provide or update the relevant parts of the documentation when creating or modifying features.
